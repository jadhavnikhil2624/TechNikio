# **Java's Starter**

Unraveling the Essence of Java Object-Oriented Programming

### <mark>Introduction</mark>:

Java is a strong and adaptable programming language that is well-known for being object-oriented and independent of platforms. Using practical examples and a thorough explanation of key ideas, this tutorial will lead you through the basic steps of getting started with Java programming.

### <mark>Your First Java Program</mark>

Let's dive into writing a simple Java program to get a feel for the language.

Example 1: [HelloJava.java](http://HelloJava.java)

![Kudos !üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To Hello World!!](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698180288/19b1815f-2489-434f-9cd1-759f0857c6d0.png align="center")

**Explanation**:

* The `public class HelloJava` defines a class named `HelloJava`.
    
* The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the entry point of the program.
    
* Inside the `main` method, `System.out.println("Hello, Java!");` prints the string "Hello, Java!" to the console.
    

### **<mark>Understanding Java Fundamentals</mark>**

**<mark>Variables and Data Types</mark>**

#### Java is a Predefined language, meaning you must declare the data type of a variable before using it.

Here's an example:

![Data Type & Variables](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698422877/c1005651-0653-4399-b738-e308acf84534.png align="center")

**<mark>Control Flow Statements</mark>**

#### Java supports essential control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch`.

**Let's look at an example:**

### **<mark>If-Else statement</mark>**:

#### If-else statement is a control flow statement that allows a program to make decisions based on a specific condition.

![Syntax: If-Else Statement](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698495504/9a3a4cb3-51d6-4ff6-9284-70451a0c30c8.png align="center")

**Example: If-Else Statement**

![If-else Statement Example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698562515/8d236ed4-167c-4a36-8242-49215f877bad.png align="center")

**Explanation:**

* This Java program initializes a variable `num` with the value 10.
    
* It then uses an if-else statement to check if the value of `num` is equal to 10.
    
* If the condition is true, it prints "Number Matched!"; otherwise, it prints "Number not Matched!".
    
* In this specific case, since `num` is indeed 10, the program will output "Number Matched!".
    

**Syntax: For Loop**

![For Loop Syntax ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698647378/e60152ad-f27d-4544-b61b-4141954f22d7.png align="center")

**Explanation:**

Here's a breakdown of each part:

* **<mark>Initialization</mark>:** This part is executed only once at the beginning. It initializes a variable used as a counter or iterator.
    
* **<mark>Condition</mark>:** The loop continues executing as long as this condition is true. If the condition becomes false, the loop exits.
    
* **<mark>Iteration</mark>:** This part is executed after each iteration of the loop. It typically increments or decrements the counter variable.
    
* **<mark>Code Block</mark>:** The block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` is the loop's body. It contains the statements to be executed in each iteration.
    

Example:

![For Loop Example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698712771/6947dd86-3657-4f24-a4cd-c3343b4fd19f.png align="center")

### **<mark>While Loop</mark>**:

* A "<mark>while loop</mark>" in Java is like a repetitive task in real life.
    
* The loop consists of the condition and a block of code.
    
* The code block is executed repeatedly as long as the condition evaluates to true.
    
* It's beneficial when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on the satisfaction of a certain condition.
    

**Syntax: While Loop**

![While Loop Syntax ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698812637/d0a3f079-2acd-4981-8f63-519ed221582a.png align="center")

**Explanation:**

Here's a breakdown of the components:

* **<mark>Condition</mark>:** The loop continues executing as long as this condition is true. If the condition becomes false, the loop exits.
    
* **<mark>Code Block</mark>:** The block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` is the loop's body. It contains the statements to be executed in each iteration.
    

**Example:**

![While Loop Example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698867946/324c2a25-2acb-4921-80ba-d5a2df04211a.png align="center")

![O/P ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698896685/8f4caae3-28f1-460d-a6d9-610271ca227d.png align="center")

### **<mark>Switch Statement</mark>**:

* A "<mark>switch statement</mark>" in Java is like a decision-making tool that helps you choose between multiple options based on the value of a variable.
    
* It allows you to check the value of a variable and execute specific code blocks depending on its value.
    
* It's similar to having different cases or choices, and the program selects the appropriate case to run, making your code more organized and readable.
    

**Syntax: Switch Statement**

![Switch Statement Syntax](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703698951925/8c12cb5b-b8fc-4a07-b578-eb2802f2b149.png align="center")

**Explanation:**

Here's a breakdown of the components:

* **<mark>Expression</mark>:** The variable or value being evaluated in the switch statement.
    
* **<mark>Case Values</mark>:** Each `case` represents a possible value that the expression might have. If the expression matches a case value, the corresponding block of code is executed.
    
* **<mark>Code Blocks</mark>:** The code to be executed for each case. It's enclosed within curly braces `{}`.
    
* **<mark>Break Statement</mark>:** The `break` statement is used to exit the switch statement. Without it, the program would continue executing the code for subsequent cases.
    
* **<mark>Default</mark>:** The `default` case is optional and provides a code block to be executed if none of the case values match the expression.
    
* ![Switch Statement Example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703699002914/6956695b-30f9-4943-b098-5667b6d75a7b.png align="center")
    

## **<mark>Conclusion</mark>**:

So, think of data types, control flow, and loops like the superheroes of coding. They help your programs do incredible things‚Äîsort data, make decisions, and repeat tasks with flair. Mastering these basics is like discovering the superpowers that make your code not just work, but work in a cool, efficient way! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª‚ú®
