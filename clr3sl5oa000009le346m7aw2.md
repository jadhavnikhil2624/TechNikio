### **1\. Introduction:**

> Greetings, fellow code enthusiasts! Today, we're delving into a concept that's more than just a set of rules; it's a game-changer in the Java programming arena. Buckle up as we explore the magical realm of interfaces!

***#CodeMagicLaughs🦸‍♂️***

### **2\. What's the Buzz about Interfaces?**

> Interfaces in Java are like the superhero capes of the coding world. They define a set of rules without getting into the nitty-gritty details of how those rules are implemented. Think of them as contracts that classes sign, promising to deliver specific functionalities.

### 3\. What are Interfaces in Java?

> * The interface in Java is *a* mechanism to achieve [**abstraction**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstraction-in-java-2/).
>     
> * There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body.
>     
> * It is used to achieve abstraction and [**multiple inheritances in Java using Interface**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-and-multiple-inheritance/).
>     
> * In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also **represents the IS-A relationship**.
>     
> * It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
>     
> * Since Java 8, we can have **default and static methods** in an interface.
>     
> * Since Java 9, we can have **private methods** in an interface.

![INTERFACE IN JAVA](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704647934493/c9fcc479-d0cd-41f5-9a3f-b9d747261867.png align="center")

### **4\. Syntax for Java Interfaces**

```java
public interface MyInterface {
    // Constant declarations (optional)
    type CONSTANT_NAME = value;

    // Abstract method declarations
    returnType methodName(parameterList);

    // More abstract method declarations

    // Default method (Java 8 and later)
    default returnType methodName() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    // Static method (Java 8 and later)
    static returnType methodName() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

> **Explanation:**
> 
> * `public interface MyInterface`: Declares a public interface named `MyInterface`.
>     
> * `type CONSTANT_NAME = value;`: Defines constants (optional).
>     
> * `returnType methodName(parameterList);`: Declares abstract methods.
>     
> * `default returnType methodName() { ... }`: Provides a default implementation for a method (Java 8 and later).
>     
> * `static returnType methodName() { ... }`: Defines a static method within the interface (Java 8 and later).
>     

### 5\. Uses of Interfaces in Java

> *Uses of Interfaces in Java are mentioned below:*
> 
> * *It is used to achieve total abstraction.*
>     
> * *Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.*
>     
> * *Any class can extend only 1 class but can any class implement an infinite number of interface.*
>     
> * *It is also used to achieve loose coupling.*
>     
> * *Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.* 
>     

Some questions arise here, those are

1. **why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?**
    

> Answer:- The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public, and static.
> 
> ```java
> // A simple interface
> 
> interface Player
> {
>     final int id = 10;
>     int move();
> }
> ```

## 6\. Relationship Between Class and Interface

A class can extend another class similar to this, and an interface can extend another interface. But only a class can extend to another interface, and vice-versa is not allowed.

![CLASS VS INTERFACE](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704648412962/61e69e08-321e-4bec-a9a6-e8595975267e.png align="center")

## 7\. Difference Between Class and Interface

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Although Class and Interface seem the same there are certain differences between Classes and Interface.</div>
</div>

The major differences between a class and an interface are mentioned below:

| **Class** | **Interface** |
| --- | --- |
| In class, you can instantiate variables and create an object. | In an interface, you can’t instantiate variables and create an object. |
| A class can contain concrete(with implementation) methods | The interface cannot contain concrete(with implementation) methods |
| The access specifiers used with classes are private, protected, and public. | In Interface only one specifier is used- Public. |

<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>Implementation: </em></strong><em>To implement an interface we use the keyword </em><strong><em>implements</em></strong></div>
</div>

### **8\. Why Interfaces?**

## 9\. How to declare an interface?

> * An interface is declared by using the interface keyword.
>     
> * It provides total abstraction; which means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body, and all the fields are public, static, and final by default.
>     
> * A class implementing an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
>     

```java
interface <interface_name>{  
      
    // declare constant fields  
    // declare methods that abstract   
    // by default.  
}//End Interface  
```

## 10\. Multiple inheritances in Java by interface

> If a class implements multiple interfaces, or an interface extends multiple interfaces, it is known as multiple inheritance.
