### **1\. Introduction:**

> Greetings, Java enthusiasts! Today, let's unravel the power of the "final" keyword a versatile gem that adds precision and clarity to your Java code. Buckle up as we explore how this keyword, whether applied to variables, methods, or classes, can elevate your coding finesse.

## **2\. The "Final" Keyword Unveiled**

![Final Keyword In Java](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704822959756/13725fa9-be8a-459e-80a6-3e60008f0f70.png align="center")

**The final keyword is used in :**

1. Variable
    
2. Method
    
3. Class  
    

### **3\. Final Variables: Constants Redefined**

> In Java, marking a variable as "final" transforms it into a constant. Once assigned, the value cannot be altered. This not only enhances code readability but also provides a safeguard against inadvertent changes.
> 
> If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
> 
> * Final Variables must be initialised.
>     
> * You can reinitialise the final variable using constructors.
>     
> * You can mark local variable as a final.
>     

```java
class Circle {
    final double PI = 3.14; // A final variable

    void calculateArea(final double radius) {
        final double area = PI * radius * radius; // A final variable in a method
        System.out.println("Area: " + area);
    }//End calculateArea
}//End class
```

### **4\. Final Methods: Immutable Blueprints**

> Declaring a method as "final" in a class prevents it from being overridden by subclasses. This enforces immutability in the method's behavior, promoting robust and predictable code.
> 
> * Final method is instance method.
>     
> * Final method cannot be overidden.
>     

1. **Preventing Method Overriding:**
    

> A final method in a class cannot be overridden by subclasses. This ensures that the behavior of the method remains constant across the class hierarchy. Any attempt to override a final method will result in a compilation error.

```java
class Parent {
    final void performOperation() {
        // Final method implementation
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Attempting to override the final method will result in a compilation error
}
```

1. **Ensuring Method Immutability:**
    

> Marking a method as final indicates that its implementation should not be changed by subclasses. This enforces method immutability, providing a clear and unmodifiable blueprint. This is particularly useful when certain behaviors need to be fixed and not altered in subclasses.

```java
class ImmutableClass {
    final void processInput(String input) {
        // Final method ensures that the processing logic remains constant
    }
}
```

1. **Compiler and Runtime Optimization:**
    

> The "final" keyword provides opportunities for compiler and runtime optimizations. Since the method cannot be overridden, the compiler may perform optimizations, and the JVM can make certain assumptions about the method's behavior, potentially leading to improved performance.

```java
final class UtilityClass {
    final int performCalculation(int a, int b) {
        // Final method allows potential compiler and runtime optimizations
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Using the "final" keyword with methods is a strategic decision that contributes to code stability, design clarity, and potential performance benefits.</div>
</div>

```java
class Parent {
    final void performOperation() {
        // Final method implementation
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Attempting to override the final method will result in a compilation error
}
```

### **5\. Final Classes: Unmodifiable Entities**

> When a class is marked as "final," it signifies that the class itself cannot be extended or subclassed. This is particularly useful when you want to create unmodifiable entities.
> 
> * Final Class cannot be extended.
>     
> * Final Class cannot be subclassed.
>     
> * Final inner Class is allowed.
>     

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>We cannot use final and abstract keywords together in methods. Want to know Why?</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">When we use an abstract method that method does not have method implementation or method body so we have to override that method in another class, But if we use final to that abstract method, can cannot override that method, because of the final keyword property.</div></details>

```java
final class UtilityClass {
    // Class with final keyword
}//End class
```

## **6\. Embracing the Benefits**

1. ### **Code Safety and Readability**
    

> The "final" keyword acts as a guardian, ensuring that values, methods, or entire classes remain unaltered where intended. This enhances code safety and readability, making your intentions clear to fellow developers.

1. ### **Performance Optimization**
    

> In certain scenarios, the JVM can optimize code more effectively when variables or methods are marked as "final." This can result in improved performance.

## **7\. Best Practices and Considerations**

> * **Choose Wisely:**
>     
>     * Apply the "final" keyword judiciously. While it brings benefits, excessive use may lead to rigid code.
>         
> * **Constants Convention:**
>     
>     * For constants, consider using uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`).
>         
> * **Immutable Objects:**
>     
>     * Combine "final" with other practices to create immutable objects for enhanced code robustness.

### **8\. How To Create A CONSTANT In Java?**

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">public final static int ABC =10; // it is known as Pure Constant</div>
</div>

> Constants are always decided in upper case.

## **Conclusion:**

> The "final" keyword in Java is a silent hero, ensuring code stability and reinforcing design choices. Embrace it wisely, and witness the transformation of your code into a robust and reliable masterpiece.
