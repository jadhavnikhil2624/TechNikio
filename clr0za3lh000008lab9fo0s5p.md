### **Introduction:**

> Greetings, coding enthusiasts! Today, we embark on a thrilling expedition into the dynamic realm of Java methods. These are the heroes of your code, the wizards that execute actions, and the powerhouse behind your programming adventures. Join us as we unravel the magic, discover the rules, and harness the superpowers of Java methods!

### **#CodeMagicLaughs*ðŸš€***

### **1\. What are Methods in Java?**

1. The **method in Java** or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller method or main method.
    
2. A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Java Methods allows us to **reuse** the code without retyping the code.
    
3. In Java, every method must be part of some class that is different from languages like C, C++, and Python.Â 
    
4. 1\. A method is like a function i.e. used to expose the behavior of an object.  
    2\. It is a set of codes that perform a particular task.
    

### **2\. Syntax:**

### **1\. Default Method Syntax:**

```java
access_modifier return_type method_name() {
    // Method body or implementation
    // Code statements go here
    
    // Return statement if the method has a return type
    return some_value;
}
```

### **2\. Parameterized Method Syntax:**

```java
access_modifier return_type method_name(parameter_type1 parameter_name1, parameter_type2 parameter_name2, ...) {
    // Method body or implementation
    // Code statements go here
    
    // Return statement if the method has a return type
    return some_value;
}//End method
```

Here's a breakdown of the elements:

* **Access Modifier:** Defines the visibility or accessibility of the method (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`, or package-private/default).
    
* **Return Type:** Specifies the type of value the method returns. Use `void` if the method doesn't return any value.
    
* **Method Name:** The name of the method, which is used to invoke it.
    
* **Method Body:** The block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` that defines what the method does.
    
* **Return Statement:** If the method has a return type other than `void`, it must include a `return` statement to send a value back to the caller.

**Example:**

### **Non-Parameterized Method:**

```java
public class Example {
    // Non-parameterized method with no return type
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    // Non-parameterized method with a return type
    public int getDefaultValue() {
        return 42;
    }
}
```

> In this example, the `greet` method is non-parameterized and has a `void` return type, while the `getDefaultValue` method returns an `int`.

### **Parameterized Method:**

```java
public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
```

> In this example, the method is named `addNumbers`, takes two `int` parameters (`a` and `b`), calculates their sum, and returns the result as an `int`.

## **3\. Types of Methods in Java**

There are two types of methods in Java

> 1. Predefined Method
>     
> 2. User-defined Method
>     

1. ### **Predefined Method**
    

In Java, predefined methods are the methods that are already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the standard library method or built-in method. We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point.Â 

1. ### **User-defined Method**
    

The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method. These methods are modified according to the requirement.

### **4\. Ways to Create Methods in Java**

> 1. Instance Method
>     
> 2. Static Method
>     

**1\. Instance Method:** Access the instance data using the object name.Declared inside a class.

*Syntax:*

```java
// Instance Method 
void method_name(){ 
body // instance area 
}
```

**2\. Static Method:** Access the static data using the class name. Declared inside class with the **static** keyword.

*Syntax:*

```java
//Static Method 
static void method_name(){ 
body // static area 
}
```

### **5\. What is Method Signature:**

It consists of the method name and a parameter list (number of parameters, type of the parameters, and order of the parameters). The return type and exceptions are not considered as part of it.Â 

Method Signature of the above function:Â Â 

```java
 max(int x, int y) Number of parameters is 2, Type of parameter is int.
```

## 6\. Method Calling

The method needs to be called for its functionality. There can be three situations when a method is called:Â   
A method returns to the code that invoked it when:Â Â 

* It completes all the statements in the method
    
* It reaches a return statement
    
* Throws an exception
    

### **Example:**

```java
public class CodingAdventure {

    // Method with no parameters and no return type
    void welcomeMessage() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Coding Adventure!");
    }

    // Method with parameters and a return type
    int addNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CodingAdventure adventure = new CodingAdventure();

        // Calling the method without parameters
        adventure.welcomeMessage();

        // Method calling with Parameters
        int sum = adventure.addNumbers(5, 7); 
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

### 7\. Advantages Of Methods In Java

1. **Modularity and Reusability:**
    
    * Break down complex programs into manageable units.
        
    * Promotes code reusability, reducing redundancy.
        
2. **Abstraction:**
    
    * Abstracts implementation details, focusing on what needs to be done.
        
3. **Code Organization and Readability:**
    
    * Enhances overall code organization.
        
    * Improves readability by dedicating methods to specific tasks.
        
4. **Parameter Passing:**
    
    * Allows methods to receive input values.
        
    * Facilitates flexible and customizable code.
        
5. **Return Values:**
    
    * Enables methods to produce meaningful outcomes.
        
    * Supports obtaining results from specific operations.
        
6. **Encapsulation:**
    
    * Hides internal workings, exposing necessary functionality.
        
    * Enhances data security and prevents unintended interference.
        
7. **Code Maintainability:**
    
    * Simplifies maintenance and updates to individual methods.
        
    * Improves overall code maintainability and scalability.
        
8. **Dynamic Polymorphism:**
    
    * Supports dynamic polymorphism through method overriding and interfaces.

### 8\. Difference between constructor and method in Java

| Java Constructor | Java Method |
| --- | --- |
| A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object. | A method is used to expose the behavior of an object. |
| A constructor must not have a return type. | A method must have a return type. |
| The constructor is invoked implicitly. | The method is invoked explicitly. |
| The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class. | The method is not provided by the compiler in any case. |
| The constructor name must be the same as the class name. | The method name may or may not be the same as the class name. |
